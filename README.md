# Web Scraper

We have created a Web Scraping Website which scrapes text contents for an entered website. In this project, data is scraped based on two parameters - the url and the keywords that are provided by the user. Any result that is displayed will take both these parameters into account.

# Objectives

1. URL and keywords are accepted from the user.
2. The data is scraped in accordance with these parameters.
3. Scraped data is delivered to the user in an ordered format.

# Installation

1. Make sure you have the Python Interpreter with the following modules installed : -requests -re -bs4 -flask
2. Clone the repository or Download the Code
3. Open your terminal and run the python file (app.py)
4. A link will appear after running this file.
5. Click on this link and use the web scraper.

# Instructions for using the Scraper

1. After you open the website on your preffered browser, Input the required url along with the necessary keywords.
2. Press the Enter button on your keyboard.
3. You will then be redirected to the results page where the scraped data result will be displayed.
